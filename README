Developing in Eclipse
=====================

If the eclipse:eclipse plugin has never been used on your workspace, run:

$ mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

To set up the project or after changing dependencies in the POM, run:

$ mvn -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true eclipse:eclipse

After changing dependencies, refresh the project in Eclipse.  For first-time 
setup, Import Project -> Existing Project, uncheck Copy to workspace before 
completing the import.


Running Locally
===============

Use the Maven Jetty plugin:

$ mvn jetty:run-war

Then access the servlets under http://127.0.0.1:8080/html2mobile/
